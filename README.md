[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pygate-webapp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pygate-webapp)


# WARNING: USES DEPRECATED RELEASE
This webapp was created as a reference implementation for the very first few releases of the Pygate gRPC client as part of the HackFS competition. Please note, that there have been significant backward incompatible changes made to Powergate and therefore Pygate since then. 

The Pygate gRPC client is actively maintained though, including compatibility with the latest Powergate releases. It includes developer quickstart examples in its [repository](https://github.com/pygate/pygate-gRPC).

# pygate-webapp
A Filecoin [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) reference application for Python developers using Textile.io's [Powergate](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/) and the [Pygate gRPC](https://github.com/pygate/pygate-gRPC) client.

# Quick installation
* `pip install pygate-webapp`
* check that the app installed properly:  
  `pygate-webapp --version`

* Start the app:  
  `pygate-webapp`
* Visit `localhost:5000` in your browser to use the app. 
* See `pygate-webapp -h` for setting options.
* You can change the Powergate server address (e.g. to a different Docker host address or an online hosted instance of Powergate that is connected to Testnet or Mainnet). Use by the -p flag on startup:  
  `pygate-webapp -p 123.123.123.123:5002`
# Developer installation
* Clone files and cd to directory:  
  `git clone https://github.com/pygate/pygate-webapp && cd pygate-webapp`  
* Set up virtualenv:  
  `virtualenv venv`  
* Activate virtualenv:  
  `source venv/bin/activate`  
* Install requirements:  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Create the application database:  
  `python create_db.py`
 * pygate-webapp is built using the [Python Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) framework. To start the built-in development server:  
 `python run.py`
* Go to `localhost:5000` in your browser to use the app.
* This is a development release of the pygate-webapp. It is designed to work with a Dockerized [Localnet Powergate](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/localnet/). It is assumed this is running at the `127.0.0.1:5002` address. You can change the POWERGATE_ADDRESS in the `config.py` file.
* Help us improve this reference implementation. If you want to fix bugs, add new features, or improve existing ones, create a `dev/[feature-name]` branch and submit a Pull Request from it. Thanks!
